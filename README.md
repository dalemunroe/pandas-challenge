Written Report

After reviewing the data the following observations can be made; 
1.  Independent schools have a higher % overall passing (i.e. 76.2% to 71.3%).
2.  Large schools (2000 to 5000 students) have a lower % overall passing by approx 8%-9% compares to medium and small schools.
3.  Schools with a higher per student spend had the lowest % overall passing, the two lower ranges had the highest % overall passing.


* Refer to validation.xlxs for calculation method.  I have used the master data table to do all the % calculations.  There is a slight variance between this method and if carry out a Groupby on schools then use this table to take mean calculations again (ie average on a avarage).
